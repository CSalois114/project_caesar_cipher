Caesar Cipher

Caesar Cipher encrypts a MESSAGE by shifting a letter up or down the 
alphabet by a KEY amount. If the KEY were 3 and the MESSAGE, “Hello!”.
The Caesar Cipher will shift each letter up the alphabet 3 spaces, 
leaving punctuation and spaces untouched but keeping capital letters 
capitalized. If a letter is shifted past the end of the alphabet it will
loop back around, “Z” with a KEY of 1 becomes “A” and “a” with a KEY of
-1 becomes “z”. caesar_cipher will accept any positive or negative KEY.

This is my first project learning sinatra.
